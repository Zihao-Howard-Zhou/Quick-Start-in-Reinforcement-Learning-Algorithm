# Easy-Algorithm-Implementation-of-Reinforcement-Learning
## Introduction
This repository is a reproduction of the reinforcement learning algorithm I have learned. It is convenient to quickly understand the implementation and principle of the algorithm in combination with theory. Due to the difficulty in obtaining the system model in practice, the algorithms to be implemented in this repository mainly focus on model-free algorithms, including value-based and policy-based, as shown below: <bar>

* Valued-based<bar>
  * Deep Q Network<bar>
  * Double DQN<bar>
  * Dueling DQN<bar>
  * ...<bar>
 * Policy-based<bar>
  * REINFORCE<bar>
  * Actor-Critic<bar>
  * ...<bar>
