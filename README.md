# Easy-Algorithm-Implementation-of-Reinforcement-Learning
## Introduction
This repository is a reproduction of the reinforcement learning algorithm I have learned. It is convenient to quickly understand the implementation and principle of the algorithm in combination with theory.<br>

 * Deep-Q-Network<br>
 * Double DQN<bar>
 * Deuling DQN<bar>
 * ...<bar>
* Policy-based<br>
 * REINFORCE<bar>
 * Actor-Critic<bar>
 * ...<bar>
